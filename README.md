# Whispering Gophers

This project is part of the Go codelab for Google I/O 2013 called "Whispering Gophers: networking programming in Go"

The original code was written mainly by [Andrew Gerrand](https://github.com/nf), and I ported it to GitHub for maintenance.

This codelab requires the ability to accept inbound and make outbound TCP connections. You may need to disable your firewall.
